A MySQL Library for Node.js

Currently creating this as a hobby project, but we'll see where it goes.

### Get it running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Create `.env` file at root with values for corresponding keys in `.env-example`
4. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`
