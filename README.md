# Forty

A MySQL Library for Node.js

Currently creating this as a hobby project, but we'll see where it goes.

### Get it running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`
4. Checkout the examples in `src/examples` to see how things work.
